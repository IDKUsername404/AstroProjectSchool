        <p>Sure, here is a paragraph about comets: Comets are fascinating celestial objects made of ice, dust, and rocky materials, often referred to as "dirty snowballs." They travel through the solar system in highly elliptical orbits, and when they come close to the Sun, the heat causes the ice to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and a spectacular tail that always points away from the Sun due to the solar wind. The size of a comet can vary widely, with some having a nucleus only a few kilometers across, while others can be much larger. Comets are thought to be remnants from the early solar system, and their study provides valuable insights into its formation and the conditions that existed billions of years ago. Their unpredictable orbits and awe-inspiring appearance in the night sky have captured the human imagination for centuries.</p>
